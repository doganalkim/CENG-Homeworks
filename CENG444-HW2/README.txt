I have provided Makefile. To compile it, I will make use of the commands there.

1 - make f  ( for flex )
2 - make b  ( for bison )
3 - make c  ( for compile )
4 - ./driver <filename> ( for execution )

Alternatively, the following command can be used to create executable named driver.
->  make f && make b && make c
