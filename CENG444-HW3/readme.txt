I have included a Makefile again.

The commands are as follows.
1 - make f ( for flex )
2 - make b ( for bison )
3 - make c ( for compilation [I have used -g flag to debug it using GDB] )

After this step, an executable named "driver" is created similar to our previous assignment.

To run, 
    ./driver <file_name>

My system is Linux Ubuntu  x64 on VirtualBox
