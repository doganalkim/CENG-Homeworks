I have provided a MakeFile for the commands. The following commands can be used to run the program.

1 - make f                                      [This is for Flex]
2 - make b                                      [This is for Bison]
3 - make c                                      [This is for compilation of source code]
4 - ./driver -p<optimization> <fileName>        [This is for running]

I have implemented the x64 bonus part.

The breakPoint for inspecting memory could be the line 102 in dgevalmain.cpp.
I observed source code by looking at the assembly version of the function f.
