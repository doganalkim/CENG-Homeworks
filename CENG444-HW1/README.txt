There is already a Makefile that I must have submitted. The content of the Makefile can be observed!

There following commands can be used respectively.

1) make f ( this is used to create lex.yy.cc )
2) make c ( to compile to create executable called lexer)
3) ./lexer <file-name>

The letters stand for:
    f -> flex 
    c -> compile  ( this will create an executebla named lexer)
